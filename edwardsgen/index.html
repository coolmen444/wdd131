        <p>The purpose of this website is to share and preserve the Edwards family's genealogical research. With years of dedication, Shon Edwards has spent many years expanding our family tree while also assisting others in discovering their own roots. This site serves as a way for those in the Edwards family to learn about their heritage, but it also here to inspire those who are not relatives to learn about their own families. Feel free to use any resources available here, including the Family Cookbook if you're looking for some new recipes to try.</p>
